         <p> I am a Junior Sports Management Major at <a href="https://www.bju.edu"> Bob Jones University </a> who lives in Greenville, SC.
         I work at <a href="https://www.dapperink.com/screen-prints"> Dapper Ink Custom Outfitters </a> as a screen printer making T-shirts everyday. 
         My goal is to one day be an Athletic Director for a christian school or a Program Director for a christian camp.</p> <p> 
         The last three summers I have served at High Point Camp in Giegertown, PA. Serving for camp has given me a passion for youth and a passion for camp ministry. 
         I also have a huge passion for sports. I would love to start my own soccer camp and teach children the fundamentals of soccer while involving the gospel.
