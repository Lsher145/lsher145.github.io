Luke Sherbondy


I am a juinor Sports Management Major at Bob Jones University Who lives in Greenville, SC. I work Dapper Ink as a screen printer making T-shirts everyday. My goal is to one day be an athletic director for a christian school or a program director for a christian camp.

The last three summers I have served at High Point Camp in Giegertown PA. Serving at camp has given me a passion for youth and a passion for camp ministry.I also have a huge passsion for sports. I would love to one day start my own soccer camp and teach children the fundimentals of soccer as well as the gospel.
